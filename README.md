# Snowflake Intelligence Demo

This project demonstrates the comprehensive Snowflake Intelligence capabilities including:
- **Cortex Analyst** (Text-to-SQL via semantic views)
- **Cortex Search** (Vector search for unstructured documents)  
- **Snowflake Intelligence Agent** (Multi-tool AI agent with orchestration)
- **Git Integration** (Automated data loading from GitHub repository)

## Key Components

### 1. Data Infrastructure

### Data Flow Explanation:
1. **Source Repository**: GitHub repository contains both CSV files (17 demo data files) and unstructured documents (PDF)
2. **Git Integration**: Git API Integration (SF_AI_DEMO_REPO) automatically syncs all files from GitHub to Snowflake's internal stage
3. **Structured Data**: CSV files populate 13 dimension tables and 4 fact tables in a star schema
4. **Unstructured Data**: PDF documents are parsed and stored in the `parsed_content` table
5. **Semantic Layer**: Business-specific semantic views provide natural language query capabilities over structured data
6. **Cortex Analyst Layer**: Each semantic view connects to a dedicated Text2SQL service for natural language to SQL conversion
7. **Search Services**: Domain-specific Cortex Search services enable vector search over unstructured documents
8. **AI Orchestration**: The Snowflake Intelligence Agent orchestrates between Text2SQL services and Search services
9. **User Access**: Users interact through API connections to the agent using natural language queries

## Database Schema

### Dimension Tables (13)
- `product_category_dim`, `product_dim`, `vendor_dim`, `customer_dim`
- `account_dim`, `department_dim`, `region_dim`, `sales_rep_dim`
- `campaign_dim`, `channel_dim`, `employee_dim`, `job_dim`, `location_dim`

### Fact Tables (4)

## Setup Instructions

**Single Script Setup**: The entire demo environment is created with one script:

1. **Run the complete setup script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute in Snowflake worksheet
   @SF_IntelligenceDemo_Full/sql_scripts/demo_setup.sql
   ```

2. **What the script creates**:
   - `SF_Intelligence_Demo` role and permissions
   - `Snow_Intelligence_demo_wh` warehouse
   - `SF_AI_DEMO.DEMO_SCHEMA` database and schema
   - Git repository integration
   - All dimension and fact tables with data
   - 4 semantic views for Cortex Analyst
   - 4 Cortex Search services for documents
   - 1 Snowflake Intelligence Agent

3. **Post-Setup Verification**:
   - Run `SHOW TABLES;` to verify 17 tables created
   - Run `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS;` to verify 4 semantic views
   - Run `SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES;` to verify 4 search services
   - Test agent: `SELECT SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS.COMPANY_CHATBOT_AGENT('What are our monthly sales for 2025?');`



## Agent Capabilities

The Company Chatbot Agent can:
- **Analyze structured data** across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and HR domains
- **Search unstructured documents** to provide context and policy information
- **Generate visualizations** including trend lines, bar charts, and analytics
- **Combine insights** from multiple data sources for comprehensive answers
- **Understand business context** and provide domain-specific insights

## Demo Script: Cross-Functional Business Analysis

The following questions demonstrate the agent's ability to perform cross-domain analysis, connecting insights across Sales, HR, Marketing, and Finance:

### 🎯 Sales Performance Analysis

   "Show me monthly sales trends for 2025 with visualizations. Which months had the highest revenue?"

2. **Top Products & Revenue Drivers**  
   "What are our top 5 products by revenue in 2025? Show me their performance by region."

3. **Sales Rep Performance**  
   "Who are our top performing sales representatives? Show their individual revenue contributions and deal counts."

### 👥 HR & Workforce Analysis
1. **Sales Rep Tenure & Performance Correlation**  
   "What is the average tenure of our top sales reps? Is there a correlation between tenure and sales performance?"

2. **Department Staffing & Costs**  
   "Show me employee headcount and average salary by department. Which departments have the highest attrition rates?"

3. **Workforce Distribution & Performance**  
   "How are our employees distributed across locations? What are the performance differences by location?"

### 📈 Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
1. **Campaign ROI & Lead Generation**  
   "Which marketing campaigns generated the most leads in 2025? Show me the cost per lead by channel."

2. **Channel Performance & Budget Allocation**  
   "Compare marketing spend and impressions across different channels. Which channels provide the best ROI?"

3. **Regional Marketing Effectiveness**  
   "How do marketing campaign results vary by region? Which regions have the highest conversion rates?"

### 💰 Finance & Cross-Domain Integration
1. **Revenue vs Marketing Spend Analysis**  
   "Compare our marketing spend to sales revenue by month. What is our marketing ROI and customer acquisition cost?"

2. **Department Profitability & Expense Analysis**  
   "Show me revenue and expenses by department. Which departments are most profitable and cost-effective?"

3. **Vendor Spend & Policy Compliance**  
   "What are our top vendor expenses? Check our vendor management policy - are we following procurement guidelines?"

### 🔍 Cross-Functional Insights
**Ultimate Cross-Domain Question**  
"Create a comprehensive business dashboard showing: sales performance by top reps, their tenure and compensation, marketing campaigns that drove their leads, and the profitability of their deals. Include any relevant policy information from our documents."

### 📋 Demo Flow Recommendation
1. **Start with Sales**: Establish baseline performance metrics
2. **Connect to HR**: Link performance to workforce characteristics  
3. **Add Marketing Context**: Show how campaigns drive sales results
4. **Financial Integration**: Demonstrate ROI and profitability analysis
5. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Combine all insights for strategic decision-making

This progression showcases how the Snowflake Intelligence Agent seamlessly connects structured data analysis with unstructured document insights across all business domains.
