### Data Flow Explanation:
1. **Source Repository**: GitHub repository contains both CSV files (20 demo data files) and unstructured documents (PDF)
2. **Git Integration**: Git API Integration (SF_AI_DEMO_REPO) automatically syncs all files from GitHub to Snowflake's internal stage
3. **Structured Data**: CSV files populate 13 dimension tables and 4 fact tables in a star schema
4. **Salesforce CRM Data**: 3 additional Salesforce tables (sf_accounts, sf_opportunities, sf_contacts) provide complete customer journey tracking
5. **Unstructured Data**: PDF documents are parsed and stored in the `parsed_content` table
6. **Semantic Layer**: Business-specific semantic views provide natural language query capabilities over structured data
7. **Marketing Revenue Attribution**: Enhanced Marketing Semantic View connects campaign data to Salesforce CRM for end-to-end ROI analysis
8. **Cortex Analyst Layer**: Each semantic view connects to a dedicated Text2SQL service for natural language to SQL conversion
9. **Search Services**: Domain-specific Cortex Search services enable vector search over unstructured documents
10. **Web Scraping Service**: Custom Python function enables real-time analysis of external web content
11. **AI Orchestration**: The Snowflake Intelligence Agent orchestrates between Text2SQL services, Search services, and Web Scraping
12. **User Access**: Users interact through API connections to the agent using natural language queries
